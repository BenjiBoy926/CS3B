The Cat in the Hat
Tell that Cat in the Hat
Said the Cat in the Hat
The Cat in the Hat
Said the Cat in the Hat
I get all those ticks and clocks, sir,
If, sir, you, sir, choose to chew, sir,
Mr. Fox, sir,
I won't do it.
I can't say.
When tweetle beetles fight,
And when they battle in a puddle,
AND when tweetle beetles battle with paddles in a puddle,
When beetles battle beetles in a puddle paddle battle
When beetles fight these battles in a bottle with their paddles
...they call this a muddle puddle tweetle poodle beetle noodle
When a fox is in the bottle where the tweetle beetles battle
with their paddles in a puddle on a noodle-eating poodle,
...a tweetle beetle noodle poodle bottled paddled
And he made a quick Santy Claus hat and a coat.
My hat is old, my teeth are gold.
My hat is old, my teeth are gold.
